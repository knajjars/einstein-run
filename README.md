# Einstein Run!

I developed this game during my coding bootcamp. 

## Game story
One of the greatest minds of all time, Albert Einstein, has been giving it thought to the idea 
that he is no longer a good physicist. If this is true, the evolution of humanity could take 
an unexpected turn, will it be our fate?.

## Controls
An equation will be displayed on the top left corner of your screen. The possible solutions will
head towards you, choose the right one by either staying on ground level, jumping medium or 
jumping high!

**PRO TIP: THE QUICKER YOU ANSWER, THE MORE POINTS YOU GET!**
